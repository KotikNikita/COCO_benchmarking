\section{Introduction}



\section{Algorithm Presentation}

The algorithm uses two strategies together to find global minima of functions. One is to focus on regions called trust regions. These evolve depending on the performance of the algorithm. The second is to approximate the objective function through a Gaussian process. In this way, the algorithm consists of an iteration of these two strategies that we explain in more detail below.


\subsection{Bayesian Optimization}

TuRBO uses a statistical model called a Gaussian process to approximate the objective function. This is a collection of random variables (possibly not enumerable) such that each finite subset follows a multivariate normal distribution. As in the finite case, this $\mathcal{GP}$ process is completely determined by a function $\mu$ and function $\Sigma$ that fulfill the role of the mean and the variance respectively.

To make predictions using this approximation, suppose we have some noisy observations of a function $f$ $$y(x) = f(x)+ \epsilon \sigma_y.$$ where $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$ ant the parameter $\sigma_y$ accounts for the amplitude of the noise. We can suppose that the probability of the observations are given by a Gaussian process where the mean is usually taken to be 0. This is, 
\begin{equation*}
    p(f(x)|\theta) = \mathcal{GP}(0,K(x,x') + I\sigma_y).
\end{equation*}
In this way we took $\Sigma$ to be some function $K$ called the kernel and the identity times $\sigma_y$ that accounts for the noise in the observations. Several choices of kernel are possible. In the case of turbo the a Mat√©rn-5/2 kernel with ARD covariance function is used. This function gives the covariance of two points as a function of its distance and its given by

$$
K(x, x' ; \zeta, \nu, \lambda_1 \dots \lambda_d)=\frac{s^2}{2^{\nu-1} \Gamma(\nu)}\left(\frac{d(x, x' ; \lambda_1 \dots \lambda_d)}{\zeta}\right)^\nu K_\nu\left(\frac{d(x, x' ; \lambda_1 \dots \lambda_d)}{\zeta}\right)
$$
In the formula the parameter $\nu $ is a parameter that accounts for the differentiability of the learned function. In our case $\nu$ is taken to be $5/2$ meaning that the learned function will be two times differentiable. $d$ is the distance between $x$ and $x'$ by doing a res-scaling according to $\lambda_{i}$. Additionally the parameters $s^2$ and $\zeta$ are the variance and another scaling factor. Finally $K_{\nu}$ is the modified Bessel function. 

 We can maximize the log likelihood function to estimate the parameters of the $\mathcal{GP}$. In the article the authors seated bounds for the hyper-parameters as follows : $\lambda_i \in [0.005,2.0]$, $s^2 \in [0.05, 20.0]$ and $\sigma^2_y \in [0.0005,0.1]$


 

\subsection{Trust region methods}

A trust region method is an optimization method that is limited to a subset of Omega (TR) in which the objective function is approximated with another function with better characteristics. The TR is updated iteratively in such a way that if our prediction is good, the TR grows and if it is bad it shrinks. In this way, we ensure that if the approximation of the objective function is good, the search area can be expanded and if it is bad, it should be decreased in order to obtain a better approximation of the objective function.

In TuRBO methodology, a subset of $q$ points from our function in the trust regions is sampled. These points are then evaluated against the current best approximation. Their performance is categorized as either successes or failures based on whether they improve upon the previous minimum. This categorization drives the adjustment of parameters $\tau_{\text{fail}}$ and $\tau_{\text{succ}}$: if failures outnumber $\tau_{\text{fail}}$, the sampling area decreases; conversely, if successes surpass $\tau_{\text{succ}}$, the sampling area expands. 

\subsection{TuRBO algorithm}

The algorithm consists of using m trust regions with m independent GP models. In each of the trust regions we set $L \longleftarrow L_{\text{init}}$. The trust region will be then an hyper rectangle of volume $L^d$. Each side of the hyper-rectangle is calculated using the parameters $\lambda_i$ of the respective $\mathcal{GP}$ of the trust region. in this way we have $L_i=\lambda_i L /\left(\prod_{j=1}^d \lambda_j\right)^{1 / d}$. After this we do the sampling of the $q$ point within the trust region and we evaluate the performance of the algorithm. The update of the trust region is done by setting $L \leftarrow \min \left\{L_{\max }, 2 L\right\}$ if we decide to increase the trust region, or $L \leftarrow  L/2$ if we shrink it. In the case $L < L_{\min}$ we discard the trust region and create another one. 

Finally to solve the problem of how to sample our badge of $q$ pints from the trust regions in each iteration TuRBO uses Thomson sampling to allocate the points in an efficient way as follows:




\subsection{parameters of the algorithm}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $L_{\text{max}}$: Maximum size of the side of the hyperrectangle
    \item $L_{\text{min}}$: Minimum size of the side of the hyperrectangle
    \item $L_{\text{init}}$: This magnitude is used to calculate the sides of the TR hyperrectangle. The true lengths are calculated such that the initial volume is $L_{\text{init}}^d$ and are scaled using the $\mathcal{GP}$ $\lambda_i$ parameters
    \item $\tau_{\text{succ}}$: If this number of successes is exceeded, the trust region is expanded.
    \item $\tau_{\text{fail}}$: If this number of failures is exceeded, the trust region is shrunk.
\end{itemize}

\section{questions}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item It seems that the algorithm does the optimization process using several regions at the same time according to the introduction, but in the description of the algorithm only one is mentioned. The algorithm consists of doing the same thing in several regions at the same time?
    \item Do we include the theory of the Gaussian process? Or are we going to see it in class?
    \item  I don't understand the change of X when the observation has noise
    \item is the formula for the kernell
    correct?

\end{enumerate}

In order to evaluate the CPU timing of the algorithm, we have run the \change{\algorithmA} with restarts on the entire \bbobls test suite \cite{varelas2020benchmarking} for $2 D$ function evaluations according to \cite{hansen2016exp}. The \change{C/Java/Matlab/Octave/Python} code was run on a \change{Mac Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-2400S CPU @ 2.50GHz} with \change{1} processor and \change{4} cores \change{and (compile) options xxx}. The time per function evaluation for dimensions 20, 40, 80, 160, 320\change{, 640} equals \change{$x.x$}, \change{$x.x$}, \change{$x.x$}, \change{$xx$}, \change{$xxx$}\change{, and $xxx$} seconds respectively.

The experiments were performed with COCO \cite{hansen2020cocoplat}, version
\change{\version}, the plots were produced with version \change{\version}.

The \textbf{expected runtime (ERT)}, used in the figures and tables,
depends on a given target function value, $\ftarget=\fopt+\Df$, and is
computed over all relevant trials as the number of function
evaluations executed during each trial while the best function value
did not reach \ftarget, summed over all trials and divided by the
number of trials that actually reached \ftarget\
\cite{hansen2012exp,price1997dev}. 
\textbf{Statistical significance} is tested with the rank-sum test for a given
target $\Delta\ftarget$ using, for each trial,
either the number of needed function evaluations to reach
$\Delta\ftarget$ (inverted and multiplied by $-1$), or, if the target
was not reached, the best $\Df$-value achieved, measured only up to
the smallest number of overall function evaluations for any
unsuccessful trial under consideration.
